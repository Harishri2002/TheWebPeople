## About the Project

This portfolio represents a digital agency's professional presence online. It includes sections such as Work Showcase, About Us, Contact Us, and Brand Logos, all aimed at presenting the company's best projects and making it easy for potential clients to get in touch.

The design is clean, modern, and minimalistic, focusing on user experience and visual appeal. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout and creating the responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like the hamburger menu.
- **Grid System**: I used CSS Grid to create a responsive and flexible layout that adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The website adapts to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Hamburger Menu**: A navigation menu that appears on mobile devices, providing a clean and simple way to navigate the site.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions are applied to elements like navigation links and buttons to provide a polished, professional user experience.
- **Contact Form**: A functional contact form that allows users to send messages to the agency.

## Grid System

I used the **CSS Grid** layout to create a flexible and organized grid system for the "Work Showcase" section. The grid ensures that images and content are displayed in a neat and structured manner, with responsive behavior across different devices.
